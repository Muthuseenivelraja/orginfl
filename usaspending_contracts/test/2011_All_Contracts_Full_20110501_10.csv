THE NEW MAC PROTOCOL INCLUDES A NOVEL MECHANISM OF TDMA OVERLAYING CSMA/CA AND ENSURES SCALABLE THROUGHPUT AND QOS PERFORMANCE IN THE HIERARCHICAL MULTIHOP WIRELESS MESH NETWORKS PROPOSED FOR LUNAR SURFACE NETWORKS. THE NEW MAC PROTOCOL WILL BE IMPLEMENTED ON TOP OF A RECONFIGURABLE 802.11 RADIO AND IS COMPATIBLE TO LEGACY 802.11 NETWORKS. IT ALSO INCLUDES ADVANCED FEATURES LIKE EFFICIENCY POWER MANAGEMENT, ADAPTIVE CHANNEL WIDTH FOR IMPROVING RECEIVER SENSITIVITY AND COMMUNICATION RANGE, AND ERROR CONTROL FOR ELIMINATE ERRORS DUE TO RADIATION AND RADIO BURST. THE HYBRID ROUTING PROTOCOL COMBINES THE ADVANTAGES OF AD-HOC ON-DEMAND DISTANCE VECTOR (AODV) ROUTING AND DISRUPTION/DELAY TOLERANT NETWORK (DTN) ROUTING. ITS PERFORMANCE IS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN AODV OR DTN, AND IS PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE TO WIRELESS NETWORKS WITH INTERMITTENT LINKS, AS IN LUNAR SURFACE NETWORKS AND ORBIT ACCESS. IN THIS PROPOSAL A DETAILED PROTOTYPING PLAN TO IMPLEMENT THE DEVELOPED PROTOCOLS IS ALSO PRESENTED.
